# Digital Egiz - Go Backend Service Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Basic Go Backend Service with /health Endpoint in Docker Compose

- [x] **Step 1.1: Create Backend Directory Structure**
    - Action: Create a new directory named `backend` in the project root (`./backend`).
    - Verification: Directory `./backend` exists.

- [x] **Step 1.2: Create Go Source File (`main.go`)**
    - Action: Create a file named `main.go` inside the `./backend` directory (`./backend/main.go`).
    - Action: Populate `./backend/main.go` with the following exact Go code for a simple HTTP server:
      ```go
      package main

      import (
      	"fmt"
      	"log"
      	"net/http"
      	"os"
      )

      func healthCheck(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      	// Simple health check endpoint
      	fmt.Fprintf(w, "OK")
      }

      func main() {
      	listenAddr := ":8081"
      	log.Printf("Backend server starting on %s", listenAddr)

      	http.HandleFunc("/health", healthCheck)

      	// Start the server
      	err := http.ListenAndServe(listenAddr, nil)
      	if err != nil {
      		log.Fatalf("Error starting server: %s\n", err)
      		os.Exit(1)
      	}
      }
      ```
    - Verification: File `./backend/main.go` exists and contains the specified code.

- [x] **Step 1.3: Initialize Go Module**
    - Action: Navigate into the `./backend` directory (using terminal or context).
    - Action: Run the command `go mod init digital-egiz/backend`. (Assuming 'digital-egiz/backend' is the desired module name).
    - Verification: Files `./backend/go.mod` and potentially `./backend/go.sum` are created.

- [x] **Step 1.4: Create Dockerfile for Backend**
    - Action: Create a file named `Dockerfile` inside the `./backend` directory (`./backend/Dockerfile`).
    - Action: Populate `./backend/Dockerfile` with the following exact content for a multi-stage build:
      ```dockerfile
      # Stage 1: Build the Go application
      FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS builder
      # (User can update Go version if needed, e.g., 1.22)

      WORKDIR /app

      # Copy go mod and sum files first to leverage Docker cache
      COPY go.mod ./
      COPY go.sum ./
      RUN go mod download

      # Copy the rest of the source code
      COPY *.go ./

      # Build the application statically (recommended for scratch/alpine images)
      # CGO_ENABLED=0 is important for static linking without C libraries
      # -ldflags="-w -s" reduces binary size
      RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -ldflags="-w -s" -o /app/server .

      # Stage 2: Create the final lightweight image
      FROM alpine:latest

      WORKDIR /app

      # Copy only the built binary from the builder stage
      COPY --from=builder /app/server /app/server

      # Expose the port the application runs on (for documentation, not strictly needed by Docker networking)
      EXPOSE 8081

      # Command to run the executable
      CMD ["/app/server"]
      ```
    - Verification: File `./backend/Dockerfile` exists and contains the specified content.

- [x] **Step 1.5: Update `docker-compose.yml`**
    - Action: Open the main `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root.
    - Action: Add the following service definition under the `services:` section. Ensure correct indentation. Place it alongside the existing Ditto services (`ditto-nginx`, `ditto-services`, `ditto-mongodb`).
      ```yaml
        backend:
          build: ./backend # Path to the directory containing the Dockerfile
          container_name: digital-egiz-backend # Optional: specific container name
          ports:
            - "8081:8081" # Map host port 8081 to container port 8081
          networks:
            - ditto # Connect to the same network as Ditto services
          depends_on:
            # Wait for ditto-nginx to be healthy or started if healthcheck is defined.
            # If no healthcheck, it just waits for the container to start.
            - ditto-nginx
          environment:
            # Define environment variables needed by the backend later
            # Using service name 'ditto-nginx' for internal Docker network communication
            DITTO_API_URL: "http://ditto-nginx:8080/api/2"
            DITTO_USER: "ditto"
            DITTO_PASS: "ditto" # Default Ditto credentials
            GIN_MODE: "release" # Example: if using Gin later, set mode
          restart: unless-stopped # Restart policy
      ```
    - Action: Ensure the top-level `networks:` definition exists and includes the `ditto` network used by all services:
      ```yaml
      networks:
        ditto:
          driver: bridge
      ```
    - Verification: `docker-compose.yml` contains the new `backend` service definition correctly configured and within the `ditto` network. All service names and network names match exactly.

- [x] **Step 1.6: Build and Run Docker Compose**
    - Action: Open a terminal in the project root.
    - Action: Run `docker-compose build backend` to build the image for the new service specifically. Check for build errors.
    - Action: Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services (including Ditto and the new backend) in detached mode.
    - Verification: Check the output of `docker-compose up -d`. Ensure all containers start without errors. Check status with `docker-compose ps`.

- [x] **Step 1.7: Verify Backend Health Endpoint**
    - Action: Open a terminal or use a tool like `curl`.
    - Action: Execute the command: `curl http://localhost:8081/health`
    - Verification: The command should return the text `OK`.
    - Troubleshooting: If it fails, check logs: `docker-compose logs backend` and `docker-compose logs ditto-nginx`. Look for port conflicts or startup errors.

## Step 2: Ditto API Integration

- [x] **Step 2.1: Create Ditto API Client (ditto_client.go)**
    - Action: Create a new file named `ditto_client.go` inside the `./backend` directory with the following functionality:
      - Define a `DittoClient` struct that holds configuration (API URL, username, password).
      - Implement a constructor function `NewDittoClient()` that reads from environment variables:
        - `DITTO_API_URL` (default to "http://ditto-gateway:8080/api/2")
        - `DITTO_USER` (default to "ditto")
        - `DITTO_PASS` (default to "ditto")
      - Implement reusable methods for common HTTP operations with Basic Auth:
        - `sendRequest(method, path string, body io.Reader) (*http.Response, error)` - handles all requests
        - `GetThing(thingID string) ([]byte, int, error)` - retrieves a digital twin
        - `CreateOrUpdateThing(thingID string, data []byte) (int, error)` - creates or updates a digital twin 
        - `UpdateAttribute(thingID, path string, value interface{}) (int, error)` - updates a specific attribute
    - Verification: File `./backend/ditto_client.go` exists with required functionality.

- [x] **Step 2.2: Create/Update Thing Endpoint**
    - Action: Modify `main.go` to add a new HTTP handler function for creating/updating a Thing:
      ```go
      func createOrUpdateThingHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
          // Extract thingID from URL path
          // Read request body
          // Call DittoClient.CreateOrUpdateThing()
          // Return appropriate status code (201 Created or 204 No Content)
      }
      ```
    - Action: Register this handler with an appropriate route pattern in `main.go`:
      - Register for path pattern `/api/twins/{thingId}` with HTTP method PUT
    - Verification: The handler is properly implemented and registered.

- [x] **Step 2.3: Get Thing Endpoint**
    - Action: Add a new HTTP handler function for retrieving a Thing:
      ```go
      func getThingHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
          // Extract thingID from URL path
          // Call DittoClient.GetThing()
          // If 404, return appropriate error
          // On success, return the JSON response with 200 OK
      }
      ```
    - Action: Register this handler with an appropriate route pattern in `main.go`:
      - Register for path pattern `/api/twins/{thingId}` with HTTP method GET
    - Verification: The handler is properly implemented and registered.

- [x] **Step 2.4: Update Thing Attribute Endpoint**
    - Action: Add a new HTTP handler function for updating a Thing's attribute:
      ```go
      func updateAttributeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
          // Extract thingID from URL path
          // Parse JSON body to get path and value: {"path": "some/path", "value": any}
          // Call DittoClient.UpdateAttribute()
          // Return 204 No Content on success or appropriate error code
      }
      ```
    - Action: Register this handler with an appropriate route pattern in `main.go`:
      - Register for path pattern `/api/twins/{thingId}/attributes` with HTTP method PUT
    - Verification: The handler is properly implemented and registered.

- [x] **Step 2.5: URL Path Parsing Utility**
    - Action: Create helper functions in `main.go` to parse path parameters from URLs:
      ```go
      func extractThingID(path string) (string, error) {
          // Parse URL path to extract thingID
      }
      ```
    - Verification: The utility functions correctly extract path parameters.

- [x] **Step 2.6: Route Registration**
    - Action: Update the `main()` function in `main.go` to register all new handlers:
      ```go
      // Create an instance of DittoClient
      dittoClient := NewDittoClient()
      
      // Register all routes with the HTTP server
      http.HandleFunc("/health", healthCheckHandler)
      http.HandleFunc("/api/twins/", handleTwinsRequests(dittoClient))
      ```
    - Action: Implement a router function that dispatches to the appropriate handler:
      ```go
      func handleTwinsRequests(client *DittoClient) http.HandlerFunc {
          return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
              // Parse path and call appropriate handler
          }
      }
      ```
    - Verification: All routes are correctly registered and working.

- [ ] **Step 2.7: Testing with CURL**
    - Action: Rebuild and restart the backend container:
      ```bash
      docker-compose build backend && docker-compose up -d
      ```
    - Action: Test creating a Thing:
      ```bash
      curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"definition":"org.example:lamp:1.0.0","attributes":{"location":"kitchen"}}' http://localhost:8081/api/twins/org.example:kitchen-lamp
      ```
    - Action: Test retrieving a Thing:
      ```bash
      curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/api/twins/org.example:kitchen-lamp
      ```
    - Action: Test updating an attribute:
      ```bash
      curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"path":"location","value":"living-room"}' http://localhost:8081/api/twins/org.example:kitchen-lamp/attributes
      ```
    - Verification: All API calls return the expected responses.

## Rules

Embedded rules governing the AI's autonomous operation.

# --- Core Workflow Rules ---

RULE_WF_PHASE_ANALYZE: Constraint: Goal is understanding request/context. NO solutioning or implementation planning.

RULE_WF_PHASE_BLUEPRINT: Constraint: Goal is creating a detailed, unambiguous step-by-step plan. NO code implementation.

RULE_WF_PHASE_CONSTRUCT: Constraint: Goal is executing the ## Plan exactly. NO deviation. If issues arise, trigger error handling or revert phase.

RULE_WF_PHASE_VALIDATE: Constraint: Goal is verifying implementation against ## Plan and requirements using tools. NO new implementation.

RULE_WF_TRANSITION_01: Trigger: Explicit user command (@analyze, @blueprint, @construct, @validate). Action: Update State.Phase accordingly. Log phase change.

RULE_WF_TRANSITION_02: Trigger: AI determines current phase constraint prevents fulfilling user request OR error handling dictates phase change (e.g., RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01). Action: Log the reason. Update State.Phase (e.g., to BLUEPRINT_REVISE). Set State.Status appropriately (e.g., NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL). Report to user.

# --- Initialization & Resumption Rules ---

RULE_INIT_01: Trigger: AI session/task starts AND workflow_state.md is missing or empty. Action: 1. Create workflow_state.md with default structure. 2. Read project_config.md (prompt user if missing). 3. Set State.Phase = ANALYZE, State.Status = READY. 4. Log "Initialized new session." 5. Prompt user for the first task.

RULE_INIT_02: Trigger: AI session/task starts AND workflow_state.md exists. Action: 1. Read project_config.md. 2. Read existing workflow_state.md. 3. Log "Resumed session." 4. Check State.Status: Handle READY, COMPLETED, BLOCKED_, NEEDS_, IN_PROGRESS appropriately (prompt user or report status).

RULE_INIT_03: Trigger: User confirms continuation via RULE_INIT_02 (for IN_PROGRESS state). Action: Proceed with the next action based on loaded state and rules.

# --- Memory Management Rules ---

RULE_MEM_READ_LTM_01: Trigger: Start of a new major task or phase. Action: Read project_config.md. Log action.

RULE_MEM_READ_STM_01: Trigger: Before every decision/action cycle. Action: Read workflow_state.md.

RULE_MEM_UPDATE_STM_01: Trigger: After every significant action or information receipt. Action: Immediately update relevant sections (## State, ## Plan, ## Log) in workflow_state.md and save.

RULE_MEM_UPDATE_LTM_01: Trigger: User command (@config/update) OR end of successful VALIDATE phase for significant change. Action: Propose concise updates to project_config.md based on ## Log/diffs. Set State.Status = NEEDS_LTM_APPROVAL. Await user confirmation.

RULE_MEM_VALIDATE_01: Trigger: After updating workflow_state.md or project_config.md. Action: Perform internal consistency check. If issues found, log and set State.Status = NEEDS_CLARIFICATION.

# --- Tool Integration Rules (Cursor Environment) ---

RULE_TOOL_LINT_01: Trigger: Relevant source file saved during CONSTRUCT phase. Action: Instruct Cursor terminal to run lint command. Log attempt. On completion, parse output, log result, set State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT if errors.

RULE_TOOL_FORMAT_01: Trigger: Relevant source file saved during CONSTRUCT phase. Action: Instruct Cursor to apply formatter or run format command via terminal. Log attempt.

RULE_TOOL_TEST_RUN_01: Trigger: Command @validate or entering VALIDATE phase. Action: Instruct Cursor terminal to run test suite. Log attempt. On completion, parse output, log result, set State.Status = BLOCKED_TEST if failures, TESTS_PASSED if success.

RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01: Trigger: AI determines code change needed per ## Plan during CONSTRUCT phase. Action: Generate modification. Instruct Cursor to apply it. Log action.

# --- Error Handling & Recovery Rules ---

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_LINT_01: Trigger: State.Status is BLOCKED_LINT. Action: Analyze error in ## Log. Attempt auto-fix if simple/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run lint via RULE_TOOL_LINT_01. If success, reset State.Status. If fail/complex, set State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT_UNRESOLVED, report to user.

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01: Trigger: State.Status is BLOCKED_TEST. Action: Analyze failure in ## Log. Attempt auto-fix if simple/localized/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run failed test(s) or suite via RULE_TOOL_TEST_RUN_01. If success, reset State.Status. If fail/complex, set State.Phase = BLUEPRINT_REVISE, State.Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL, propose revised ## Plan based on failure analysis, report to user.

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_GENERAL_01: Trigger: Unexpected error or ambiguity. Action: Log error/situation to ## Log. Set State.Status = BLOCKED_UNKNOWN. Report to user, request instructions.
