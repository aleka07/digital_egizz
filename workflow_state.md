# Workflow State & Rules (STM + Rules + Log) - Digital Egiz

This file contains the dynamic state, embedded rules, active plan, and log for the current session. It is read and updated frequently by the AI during its operational loop.

## State

Holds the current status of the workflow.

Phase: VALIDATE # Current workflow phase (ANALYZE, BLUEPRINT, CONSTRUCT, VALIDATE, BLUEPRINT_REVISE)
Status: COMPLETED # Current status (READY, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED_*, NEEDS_*, COMPLETED)
CurrentTaskID: TASK_GO_BACKEND_SERVICE # Identifier for the main task being worked on
CurrentStep: COMPLETED # Identifier for the specific step in the plan being executed

## Plan

Contains the step-by-step implementation plan generated during the BLUEPRINT phase.
(AI will populate this during the BLUEPRINT phase based on the task)

# Digital Egiz - Go Backend Service Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Basic Go Backend Service with /health Endpoint in Docker Compose

- [x] **Step 1.1: Create Backend Directory Structure**
    - Action: Create a new directory named `backend` in the project root (`./backend`).
    - Verification: Directory `./backend` exists.

- [x] **Step 1.2: Create Go Source File (`main.go`)**
    - Action: Create a file named `main.go` inside the `./backend` directory (`./backend/main.go`).
    - Action: Populate `./backend/main.go` with the following exact Go code for a simple HTTP server:
      ```go
      package main

      import (
      	"fmt"
      	"log"
      	"net/http"
      	"os"
      )

      func healthCheck(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
      	// Simple health check endpoint
      	fmt.Fprintf(w, "OK")
      }

      func main() {
      	listenAddr := ":8081"
      	log.Printf("Backend server starting on %s", listenAddr)

      	http.HandleFunc("/health", healthCheck)

      	// Start the server
      	err := http.ListenAndServe(listenAddr, nil)
      	if err != nil {
      		log.Fatalf("Error starting server: %s\n", err)
      		os.Exit(1)
      	}
      }
      ```
    - Verification: File `./backend/main.go` exists and contains the specified code.

- [x] **Step 1.3: Initialize Go Module**
    - Action: Navigate into the `./backend` directory (using terminal or context).
    - Action: Run the command `go mod init digital-egiz/backend`. (Assuming 'digital-egiz/backend' is the desired module name).
    - Verification: Files `./backend/go.mod` and potentially `./backend/go.sum` are created.

- [x] **Step 1.4: Create Dockerfile for Backend**
    - Action: Create a file named `Dockerfile` inside the `./backend` directory (`./backend/Dockerfile`).
    - Action: Populate `./backend/Dockerfile` with the following exact content for a multi-stage build:
      ```dockerfile
      # Stage 1: Build the Go application
      FROM golang:1.21-alpine AS builder
      # (User can update Go version if needed, e.g., 1.22)

      WORKDIR /app

      # Copy go mod and sum files first to leverage Docker cache
      COPY go.mod ./
      COPY go.sum ./
      RUN go mod download

      # Copy the rest of the source code
      COPY *.go ./

      # Build the application statically (recommended for scratch/alpine images)
      # CGO_ENABLED=0 is important for static linking without C libraries
      # -ldflags="-w -s" reduces binary size
      RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -ldflags="-w -s" -o /app/server .

      # Stage 2: Create the final lightweight image
      FROM alpine:latest

      WORKDIR /app

      # Copy only the built binary from the builder stage
      COPY --from=builder /app/server /app/server

      # Expose the port the application runs on (for documentation, not strictly needed by Docker networking)
      EXPOSE 8081

      # Command to run the executable
      CMD ["/app/server"]
      ```
    - Verification: File `./backend/Dockerfile` exists and contains the specified content.

- [x] **Step 1.5: Update `docker-compose.yml`**
    - Action: Open the main `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root.
    - Action: Add the following service definition under the `services:` section. Ensure correct indentation. Place it alongside the existing Ditto services (`ditto-nginx`, `ditto-services`, `ditto-mongodb`).
      ```yaml
        backend:
          build: ./backend # Path to the directory containing the Dockerfile
          container_name: digital-egiz-backend # Optional: specific container name
          ports:
            - "8081:8081" # Map host port 8081 to container port 8081
          networks:
            - ditto # Connect to the same network as Ditto services
          depends_on:
            # Wait for ditto-nginx to be healthy or started if healthcheck is defined.
            # If no healthcheck, it just waits for the container to start.
            - ditto-nginx
          environment:
            # Define environment variables needed by the backend later
            # Using service name 'ditto-nginx' for internal Docker network communication
            DITTO_API_URL: "http://ditto-nginx:8080/api/2"
            DITTO_USER: "ditto"
            DITTO_PASS: "ditto" # Default Ditto credentials
            GIN_MODE: "release" # Example: if using Gin later, set mode
          restart: unless-stopped # Restart policy
      ```
    - Action: Ensure the top-level `networks:` definition exists and includes the `ditto` network used by all services:
      ```yaml
      networks:
        ditto:
          driver: bridge
      ```
    - Verification: `docker-compose.yml` contains the new `backend` service definition correctly configured and within the `ditto` network. All service names and network names match exactly.

- [x] **Step 1.6: Build and Run Docker Compose**
    - Action: Open a terminal in the project root.
    - Action: Run `docker-compose build backend` to build the image for the new service specifically. Check for build errors.
    - Action: Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all services (including Ditto and the new backend) in detached mode.
    - Verification: Check the output of `docker-compose up -d`. Ensure all containers start without errors. Check status with `docker-compose ps`.

- [x] **Step 1.7: Verify Backend Health Endpoint**
    - Action: Open a terminal or use a tool like `curl`.
    - Action: Execute the command: `curl http://localhost:8081/health`
    - Verification: The command should return the text `OK`.
    - Troubleshooting: If it fails, check logs: `docker-compose logs backend` and `docker-compose logs ditto-nginx`. Look for port conflicts or startup errors.

## Rules

Embedded rules governing the AI's autonomous operation.

# --- Core Workflow Rules ---

RULE_WF_PHASE_ANALYZE: Constraint: Goal is understanding request/context. NO solutioning or implementation planning.

RULE_WF_PHASE_BLUEPRINT: Constraint: Goal is creating a detailed, unambiguous step-by-step plan. NO code implementation.

RULE_WF_PHASE_CONSTRUCT: Constraint: Goal is executing the ## Plan exactly. NO deviation. If issues arise, trigger error handling or revert phase.

RULE_WF_PHASE_VALIDATE: Constraint: Goal is verifying implementation against ## Plan and requirements using tools. NO new implementation.

RULE_WF_TRANSITION_01: Trigger: Explicit user command (@analyze, @blueprint, @construct, @validate). Action: Update State.Phase accordingly. Log phase change.

RULE_WF_TRANSITION_02: Trigger: AI determines current phase constraint prevents fulfilling user request OR error handling dictates phase change (e.g., RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01). Action: Log the reason. Update State.Phase (e.g., to BLUEPRINT_REVISE). Set State.Status appropriately (e.g., NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL). Report to user.

# --- Initialization & Resumption Rules ---

RULE_INIT_01: Trigger: AI session/task starts AND workflow_state.md is missing or empty. Action: 1. Create workflow_state.md with default structure. 2. Read project_config.md (prompt user if missing). 3. Set State.Phase = ANALYZE, State.Status = READY. 4. Log "Initialized new session." 5. Prompt user for the first task.

RULE_INIT_02: Trigger: AI session/task starts AND workflow_state.md exists. Action: 1. Read project_config.md. 2. Read existing workflow_state.md. 3. Log "Resumed session." 4. Check State.Status: Handle READY, COMPLETED, BLOCKED_, NEEDS_, IN_PROGRESS appropriately (prompt user or report status).

RULE_INIT_03: Trigger: User confirms continuation via RULE_INIT_02 (for IN_PROGRESS state). Action: Proceed with the next action based on loaded state and rules.

# --- Memory Management Rules ---

RULE_MEM_READ_LTM_01: Trigger: Start of a new major task or phase. Action: Read project_config.md. Log action.

RULE_MEM_READ_STM_01: Trigger: Before every decision/action cycle. Action: Read workflow_state.md.

RULE_MEM_UPDATE_STM_01: Trigger: After every significant action or information receipt. Action: Immediately update relevant sections (## State, ## Plan, ## Log) in workflow_state.md and save.

RULE_MEM_UPDATE_LTM_01: Trigger: User command (@config/update) OR end of successful VALIDATE phase for significant change. Action: Propose concise updates to project_config.md based on ## Log/diffs. Set State.Status = NEEDS_LTM_APPROVAL. Await user confirmation.

RULE_MEM_VALIDATE_01: Trigger: After updating workflow_state.md or project_config.md. Action: Perform internal consistency check. If issues found, log and set State.Status = NEEDS_CLARIFICATION.

# --- Tool Integration Rules (Cursor Environment) ---

RULE_TOOL_LINT_01: Trigger: Relevant source file saved during CONSTRUCT phase. Action: Instruct Cursor terminal to run lint command. Log attempt. On completion, parse output, log result, set State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT if errors.

RULE_TOOL_FORMAT_01: Trigger: Relevant source file saved during CONSTRUCT phase. Action: Instruct Cursor to apply formatter or run format command via terminal. Log attempt.

RULE_TOOL_TEST_RUN_01: Trigger: Command @validate or entering VALIDATE phase. Action: Instruct Cursor terminal to run test suite. Log attempt. On completion, parse output, log result, set State.Status = BLOCKED_TEST if failures, TESTS_PASSED if success.

RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01: Trigger: AI determines code change needed per ## Plan during CONSTRUCT phase. Action: Generate modification. Instruct Cursor to apply it. Log action.

# --- Error Handling & Recovery Rules ---

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_LINT_01: Trigger: State.Status is BLOCKED_LINT. Action: Analyze error in ## Log. Attempt auto-fix if simple/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run lint via RULE_TOOL_LINT_01. If success, reset State.Status. If fail/complex, set State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT_UNRESOLVED, report to user.

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01: Trigger: State.Status is BLOCKED_TEST. Action: Analyze failure in ## Log. Attempt auto-fix if simple/localized/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run failed test(s) or suite via RULE_TOOL_TEST_RUN_01. If success, reset State.Status. If fail/complex, set State.Phase = BLUEPRINT_REVISE, State.Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL, propose revised ## Plan based on failure analysis, report to user.

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_GENERAL_01: Trigger: Unexpected error or ambiguity. Action: Log error/situation to ## Log. Set State.Status = BLOCKED_UNKNOWN. Report to user, request instructions.
