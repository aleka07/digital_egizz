# Workflow State & Rules (STM + Rules + Log) - Digital Egiz

This file contains the dynamic state, embedded rules, active plan, and log for the current session. It is read and updated frequently by the AI during its operational loop.

## State

Holds the current status of the workflow.

Phase: VALIDATE # Current workflow phase (ANALYZE, BLUEPRINT, CONSTRUCT, VALIDATE, BLUEPRINT_REVISE)
Status: COMPLETED # Current status (READY, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED_*, NEEDS_*, COMPLETED)
CurrentTaskID: TASK_INITIAL_SETUP # Identifier for the main task being worked on
CurrentStep: COMPLETED # Identifier for the specific step in the plan being executed

## Plan

Contains the step-by-step implementation plan generated during the BLUEPRINT phase.
(AI will populate this during the BLUEPRINT phase based on the task)

# Digital Egiz - Initial Project Setup Plan

## Step 1: Establish Project Structure
- Create root project directory
- Set up Go module and main backend directory structure
  - `/backend` - Main Go service directory
  - `/backend/cmd` - Entry points
  - `/backend/internal` - Internal packages
  - `/backend/api` - API definitions
  - `/backend/pkg` - Shared packages
- Create Docker configuration directory
  - `/docker` - Docker related files
  - `/docker/ditto` - Eclipse Ditto configuration

## Step 2: Set Up Go Backend
- Initialize Go module with `go mod init github.com/user/digital-egiz`
- Create main.go entry point with minimal server implementation
- Implement basic health check endpoint at `/health`
- Set up configuration loading from environment variables
- Implement basic logging
- Create Dockerfile for Go backend

## Step 3: Eclipse Ditto Docker Setup
- Create Docker Compose configuration for Eclipse Ditto
- Configure environment variables and volumes
- Ensure MongoDB persistence is properly configured

## Step 4: API Design Foundation
- Design basic RESTful API endpoints for:
  - Digital twin creation
  - Digital twin retrieval
  - Digital twin update
  - Digital twin deletion
- Create API documentation skeleton

## Step 5: Main Docker Compose Integration
- Create root docker-compose.yml combining:
  - Eclipse Ditto services
  - Go backend service
- Configure networking between services
- Set up environment variables for configuration
- Add volume mounts for persistence

## Step 6: Basic README and Documentation
- Create README.md with:
  - Project overview
  - Setup instructions
  - Basic usage guide
- Document API endpoints

## Step 7: Initial Testing
- Create basic Go tests for the health endpoint
- Test Docker Compose setup locally

## Rules

Embedded rules governing the AI's autonomous operation.

# --- Core Workflow Rules ---

RULE_WF_PHASE_ANALYZE: Constraint: Goal is understanding request/context. NO solutioning or implementation planning.

RULE_WF_PHASE_BLUEPRINT: Constraint: Goal is creating a detailed, unambiguous step-by-step plan. NO code implementation.

RULE_WF_PHASE_CONSTRUCT: Constraint: Goal is executing the ## Plan exactly. NO deviation. If issues arise, trigger error handling or revert phase.

RULE_WF_PHASE_VALIDATE: Constraint: Goal is verifying implementation against ## Plan and requirements using tools. NO new implementation.

RULE_WF_TRANSITION_01: Trigger: Explicit user command (@analyze, @blueprint, @construct, @validate). Action: Update State.Phase accordingly. Log phase change.

RULE_WF_TRANSITION_02: Trigger: AI determines current phase constraint prevents fulfilling user request OR error handling dictates phase change (e.g., RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01). Action: Log the reason. Update State.Phase (e.g., to BLUEPRINT_REVISE). Set State.Status appropriately (e.g., NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL). Report to user.

# --- Initialization & Resumption Rules ---

RULE_INIT_01: Trigger: AI session/task starts AND workflow_state.md is missing or empty. Action: 1. Create workflow_state.md with default structure. 2. Read project_config.md (prompt user if missing). 3. Set State.Phase = ANALYZE, State.Status = READY. 4. Log "Initialized new session." 5. Prompt user for the first task.

RULE_INIT_02: Trigger: AI session/task starts AND workflow_state.md exists. Action: 1. Read project_config.md. 2. Read existing workflow_state.md. 3. Log "Resumed session." 4. Check State.Status: Handle READY, COMPLETED, BLOCKED_, NEEDS_, IN_PROGRESS appropriately (prompt user or report status).

RULE_INIT_03: Trigger: User confirms continuation via RULE_INIT_02 (for IN_PROGRESS state). Action: Proceed with the next action based on loaded state and rules.

# --- Memory Management Rules ---

RULE_MEM_READ_LTM_01: Trigger: Start of a new major task or phase. Action: Read project_config.md. Log action.

RULE_MEM_READ_STM_01: Trigger: Before every decision/action cycle. Action: Read workflow_state.md.

RULE_MEM_UPDATE_STM_01: Trigger: After every significant action or information receipt. Action: Immediately update relevant sections (## State, ## Plan, ## Log) in workflow_state.md and save.

RULE_MEM_UPDATE_LTM_01: Trigger: User command (@config/update) OR end of successful VALIDATE phase for significant change. Action: Propose concise updates to project_config.md based on ## Log/diffs. Set State.Status = NEEDS_LTM_APPROVAL. Await user confirmation.

RULE_MEM_VALIDATE_01: Trigger: After updating workflow_state.md or project_config.md. Action: Perform internal consistency check. If issues found, log and set State.Status = NEEDS_CLARIFICATION.

# --- Tool Integration Rules (Cursor Environment) ---

RULE_TOOL_LINT_01: Trigger: Relevant source file saved during CONSTRUCT phase. Action: Instruct Cursor terminal to run lint command. Log attempt. On completion, parse output, log result, set State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT if errors.

RULE_TOOL_FORMAT_01: Trigger: Relevant source file saved during CONSTRUCT phase. Action: Instruct Cursor to apply formatter or run format command via terminal. Log attempt.

RULE_TOOL_TEST_RUN_01: Trigger: Command @validate or entering VALIDATE phase. Action: Instruct Cursor terminal to run test suite. Log attempt. On completion, parse output, log result, set State.Status = BLOCKED_TEST if failures, TESTS_PASSED if success.

RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01: Trigger: AI determines code change needed per ## Plan during CONSTRUCT phase. Action: Generate modification. Instruct Cursor to apply it. Log action.

# --- Error Handling & Recovery Rules ---

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_LINT_01: Trigger: State.Status is BLOCKED_LINT. Action: Analyze error in ## Log. Attempt auto-fix if simple/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run lint via RULE_TOOL_LINT_01. If success, reset State.Status. If fail/complex, set State.Status = BLOCKED_LINT_UNRESOLVED, report to user.

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_TEST_01: Trigger: State.Status is BLOCKED_TEST. Action: Analyze failure in ## Log. Attempt auto-fix if simple/localized/confident. Apply fix via RULE_TOOL_APPLY_CODE_01. Re-run failed test(s) or suite via RULE_TOOL_TEST_RUN_01. If success, reset State.Status. If fail/complex, set State.Phase = BLUEPRINT_REVISE, State.Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL, propose revised ## Plan based on failure analysis, report to user.

RULE_ERR_HANDLE_GENERAL_01: Trigger: Unexpected error or ambiguity. Action: Log error/situation to ## Log. Set State.Status = BLOCKED_UNKNOWN. Report to user, request instructions.
